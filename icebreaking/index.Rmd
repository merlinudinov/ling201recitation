## You are all Sherlock Holmes now

### Time

Good morning, everyone. My name is Merlin, and I’m delighted to welcome you to our course. In this class we shall explore how language works, from the smallest sounds to the most fascinating structures. You may notice that I pronounce certain words rather differently from what you usually hear. For instance, I say bath with a long vowel, not short, and schedule with a ‘sh’ sound rather than a ‘sk’. You’ll also hear me articulate the ‘r’ at the ends of words far less.
