## **More Terms**
<br>
### Compounding vs. Affixation
<br>
**compounding**: combining two or more roots into a single word

- <img src="../pic/0919/german.png" width="65%">

Then the following word in Kazakh is **NOT** compounding:

- <img src="../pic/0919/kazakh.png" width="80%">

## **More Terms**
<br>
### Reduplication
<br>
.pull-left[
**full reduplication**: repeat **ALL** of a morpheme
- Indonesian plural
  - *orang* 'person' $\rightarrow$ *orang*-*orang* 'people'
- Chinese intensified adjective:
  - <em>kʰai<sup>55</sup>ʂin<sup>55</sup></em> 'happy' $\rightarrow$ <em>kʰai<sup>55</sup>kʰai<sup>55</sup> ʂin<sup>55</sup>ʂin<sup>55</sup></em> 'very happy'
<br><br>

**partial reduplication**: repeat **PART** of a morpheme
- Tagalog future
  - *bili* 'buy' $\rightarrow$ *<b>bi</b>-bili* 'will buy'
- Kazakh intensified adjective:
  - *tætti* 'sweet' $\rightarrow$ *<b>tæp</b>-tætti* 'very sweet'

## **More Terms**
<br>
### Alternation, Suppletion, Zero-derivation
<br>
.pull-left[
<img src="../pic/0919/suppletion.jpg" width="90%">
]
.pull-right[
**alternation**: changing one ore more sounds within the morpheme (not the whole morpheme)
  - allomorphy is technically a type of alternation, one in which there is no difference in meaning
  - g**oo**se / g**ee**se; r**i**ng / r**a**ng / r**u**ng
<br><br>

**suppletion**: an **inflected** form is phonetically very different from other forms of the same word
  - go / went; good / better / best
<br><br>  
  
**zero-derivation**: change a word's part of speech **without adding anything** at all

## **A Little Practice**
<br><br>
Identify the **morphological processes** involved in each of the following words.
<br><br>
<b>affixation</b> (prefixation, suffixation), <b>compounding</b>, <b>reduplication</b>, <b>alternation</b>, <b>suppletion</b>
<br><br>
.pull-left[
- feed → fed <br><br>
- leaf → leaves <br><br>
- peace → peaceful <br><br>
- foot, ball → football <br><br>
- good → best <br><br>
- chair, woman → chairwomen <br><br>
- back, pack → backpacks <br><br>
]
.pull-right[
<img src="../pic/0919/coffee.jpeg" width="80%"> <br><br>
- like → like-liked <br><br>
- go → underwent <br><br>
- ox → oxen

## **Order of Affixation**

### unbelievable vs. renewable
<br>
.pull-left[
- How many morphemes does each have? <br><br>
- What is the root? <br><br>
- Is there a prefix or suffix? <br><br>
]

.pull-right[
<img src="../pic/0919/joey.gif" width="80%">
]

--

- they're pretty similar: prefix-**ROOT**-suffix <br><br>

--

.pull-left[
- **BUT BUT BUT**
  - Is it un + believable or unbelieve + able?
  - Is it renew + able or re + newable?
]

--
.pull-right[
**believ**-able vs. un-**believe** <br><br>
re-**new** vs. **new**-able
]

---
## **Order of Affixation**
<br><br>
**ORDER OF AFFIXATION**: the order in which you add affixes to a root <br><br>

It does play a role in the morphology of a word: <br><br>
  - different words have different orders of affixation (un + believable / renew + able)<br><br>
  - order of affixation is part of our mental grammar <br><br>
  - to **test** the order: we **add** an affix and see if it makes a real word<br><br>
  - also, to **test** the order: we try to **understand** what the word means<br><br>
    - If the definition involves some **smaller** combination of the root and an affix, it suggests that that affix is added first (un-[**believ**-able]) <br><br>
  - Neither of these tests works 100% of the time, so you should try a combination of them

---
## **Hierarchical Structure**
<br><br>
.pull-left[<img src="../pic/0919/cow.jpeg" width="90%">]
.pull-right[
- Order of affixation is somehow connected to the **meaning** of a word
- The fact that we can't add affixes in any old order suggests that words have a **hierarchical structure**
We can visualize this structure with a **tree diagram**.
- We start at the bottom with the root and build upward, adding affixes until we get to the full word at the top
- An alternative is **labeled bracketing**, which is more compact but perhaps less intuitive:
<br><br>
<span style="color:red">[<sub>Adj</sub> un </span><span style="color:green">[<sub>Adj</sub></span> <span style="color:blue">[<sub>V</sub> believe ]</span><span style="color:green"> able ]</span> <span style="color:red">]</span>
<br><br>
<span style="color:red">[<sub>Adj</sub></span> <span style="color:green">[<sub>V</sub> re</span><span style="color:blue"> [<sub>Adj</sub> new ]</span> <span style="color:green">]</span><span style="color:red"> able ]</span>

## How to draw a morphological tree 
### **De-humid-ify-er**
<br>
1. Identify the word's morphemes and write them out separately in one row
2. Identify the root (or roots) and label its **part of speech**
3. Look at the morphemes immediately before and after the root. **Which one is added first**? Draw lines upward connecting them, and label the new word's part of speech
4. This new word becomes the base you'll keep building off of. **Repeat step 3** using this new base instead of the root, and continue until you have no unconnected morphemes left

## Practice: Hierarchical structure
<br>
.pull-left[
Draw a **tree** or give **bracket labeling** for the following words: <br><br>
1. disappearance <br><br>
2. silliness <br><br>
3. unthinkable <br><br>
4. overgeneralisation <br><br>
5. internationalism
]

.pull-right[
**HINTS**<br><br>
- find the root and move outward/upward <br><br>
- mark the part of speech at every step <br><br>
- If adding an affix makes a non-word, try adding another affix instead <br><br>
- If adding an affix makes something that seems unrelated to the overall word's meaning, try adding a different affix instead

## **Undoable**
<br>
.pull-left[
- What does **undoable** mean? <br><br>
- *undo* + *able* vs. *un* + *doable*<br><br>
<img src="../pic/0919/ambi1.jpeg" width="80%">
]
--
.pull-right[
- This is an example of a word with an **ambiguous structure**<br><br>
- Depending on the structure you assign it, it has a **different meaning**<br><br>
- both meanings are acceptable <br><br>
- The **meaning** of words is directly affected by their morphological structure<br><br>
- That's why **structure** is very important:
  - Without knowing the structure, we wouldn't know how to put together the meanings of a word's different morphemes to create the full word.

## Practice: Ambiguous Structures
<br>
.pull-left[
Are the following words ambiguous? If yes, provide **labeled bracketings** for both readings and explain what each reaching means. If no, explain why not.<br><br>
1. immeasurable <br><br>
2. unwrappable <br><br>
3. unbearable <br><br>
