  - Hi, Prof. G. Please solve $x$ for $2x+1=0$.
  - Sure thing! We can think it this way. **2** halves become a complete **1**, so $2x=1$...<br><br>
- Asking "what is **equation**?" is fine, but "solve **this equation**" is not

What is **Linguistics**?
- Literature Studies, Language Learning...?

<br><br>
Linguistics is the **scientific** study of language

A primary goal of linguistics is to figure out what is in people’s **mental grammar**

## **Mental Grammar**
.pull-left[
### Grammar is in our **MIND**! 
- **cognitive** and **mental**.

<br>
### a paradox
- I ain't got no time.

- **good**, we understand, accept and use it.
- **bad**, double negation is not allowed.
<br><br>

- So how can the sentence both be **good** and **bad** at the same time?
<br><br>

- **PRESCRIPTIVISM** vs. **DESCRIPTIVISM**

## **Prescriptivism**
<br>
.pull-left[
- there is only one "**correct**" way to talk <br><br>
- it tells people what they **should** and **shouldn't** do (it prescribes languages) <br><br>
  - **Don't** use double negatives.
  - **Don't** split your infinitives.
  - **Ain't** ain't a word.
  - **Don't** end sentences with a preposition.<br><br>
- English speakers break these rules all the time
<br><br>
  - I **can’t** get **no** satisfaction.
  - **To** boldly **go** where no one has gone.
  - If it **ain’t** broke, don’t fix it.
  - What is she up **to**?

## **Descriptivism**
<br>
.pull-left[
![width=80%](../pic/0905/native.jpeg)
]
.pull-right[
- An alternative approach to **describe** how people **REALLY** talk daily without judgment <br><br>
- Linguists take a **descriptive** approach<br><br>
- **Because**:<br><br>
  - it helps maintain a **neutral**, **scientific** point of view.
  - we won't get very far by focusing on prescriptive rules.
  - It **respects** the language patterns of every individual and community as completely **legitimate** and **valid** ways to talk.

## **grammatical vs. ungrammatical**
<br>
.pull-left[
- **Grammatical**: Language that would be **said and understood** by a native speaker, and would sound **natural** to a native speaker<br><br>
- **Ungrammatical**: Language that would **NOT** be said or understood by a native speaker<br><br>
  - $*$ John has finishing his homework.
  - $*$ This apples is delicious.<br><br>
- Speakers may disagree on what is grammatical based on their own mental grammar <br><br>
- language can be **non-standard** but still **grammatical**<br><br>
  - How about them apples!
  - I don't want none!

## **standard** vs. **non-standard** language
<br>
.pull-left[
- Since we take **descriptivism**, we need to **avoid** judgmental terms <br><br>
  - ~~bad grammar~~
  - ~~incorrect language~~
  - ~~broken English~~
<br><br>
- **standard language**: the variety taught in schools and used in **formal and official settings** like the workplace, education, government, newsmedia, textbooks, etc.
<br><br>
- **non-standard language**: other varieties used in more colloquial settings
]

.pull-right[
![width=80%](../pic/0905/bad.png)

- The standard variety is often a bit artificial and no one speaks that way all the time
- People may disagree on what counts as standard or non-standard
- Non-standard language may be **stigmatized** in some cases, but - it is just as legitimate and expressive as standard language. There is nothing inherently "better" or "worse" about any variety or language
]

## (un)grammatical & (non-)standard
<br>
.pull-left[
In groups, **invent three English sentences**: <br><br>
1. A grammatical, standard English sentence.
2. A grammatical, non-standard English sentence.
3. An ungrammatical English sentence.

<br>
Pick **one** of your group's sentences to read aloud for the rest of the class. The rest of the class will have to figure out which one it is.

## Rules are **variable**
<br>
.pull-left[
- We've seen that language follows mental rules, and that non-standard varieties also have rules<br><br>
- Another important point: the rules of language are often variable<br><br>
- Not everyone speaks the same, and not everyone has the same mental rules<br><br>
- Grammar often varies by region, community, and other social factors but no matter where you're from, you still have a mental grammar
]

.pull-right[

Each one of these sentences is used in one or more varieties of American English. Which of them sound natural to you? If not, how would you say it?
<br><br>
1. She was standing on line for tickets.
2. It’s a quarter of three in the afternoon.
3. I thought you might could help me.
4. Do you want to come with?
5. He doesn’t have no time.
6. I'm finished my homework.
7. My shirt needs washed.
8. He had went to the store.

Major subfields of linguistics are:<br><br>
- **Phonetics** – physical attributes of speech sounds<br><br>
- **Phonology** – speech sounds considered as a system<br><br>
- **Morphology** – structure of words<br><br>
- **Syntax** – structure of sentences<br><br>
- **Semantics** – literal meaning<br><br>
- **Pragmatics** – implied meaning<br><br>

Science uses the **scientific method** to test hypotheses about how natural phenomena (in our case, language) work:
1. Develop a **hypothesis** grounded in personal observations, theory, and previous research<br><br>
2. **Design an experiment** to collect real-world (empirical) data to test your hypothesis<br><br>
3. Run your experiment, **collect** your data<br><br>
4. **Analyse your data** - is your hypothesis true or false?<br><br>
5. Based on your results, update your theories, develop a new hypothesis, and **repeat**!

1. I found everyone around me is a linguist (**observation**)<br><br>
2. I thought that every Rutgers student is a linguist (**hypothesis**)<br><br>
3. I went out and asked every one (**experiment**)<br><br>
4. I found a Rutgers student who is actually mathematician (**reject**)<br><br>
5. I have a new hypothesis! (**repeat**)

Come up with your own experiment!
- Most English permits only 1 modal/clause: I <u>*might*</u> eat. I <u>*could*</u> eat.<br><br>
- Southern American English permits 2: I <u>*might*</u> <u>*could*</u> eat.
Come up with a hypothesis – a statement that could be true or false – about English modals. (Ideas: Where specifically? What about other modals: can, may, should, oughta? Does anyone use more than 2?) <br><br>
- What kind of data could you collect to prove or disprove your hypothesis? How could you design an experiment to collect that data?
