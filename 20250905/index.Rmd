# Recitation Week 1 topics

Please cover the following topics during your Week 1 recitation:
- Icebreaker activity
- Remind students that grammar is a cognitive/mental phenomenon and linguistics is the scientific study of language
- Prescriptivism vs. descriptivism
- Standard vs. non-standard language – and idea that all languages and varieties have a mental grammar
- Main subfields of linguistics
- If there's time: what makes linguistics a science
- Remind students about Intro Survey due Sunday and Morphology reading to do by Wednesday
- AI policy: you can use the technology, but you are not allowed to use it to answer the questions. You can ask for example, what is a bound morpheme as a term, but you cannot ask how do you break this word into morphemes in a specific language…
- if you use AI in homework, you have to tell us in the homework, what did AI tell you
- look out for somewhere that everyone gets wrong, look out for something that is beyond what we have told them
- trees have to be done by hand
- syntax tree starts with an S, does not seem to be what we have told them
- by-hand homework needs to be scanned back and uploaded
- reinforce when we will have the first homework
- space for asking questions about syllabus

I'm including sample slides/activities you can use for the recitation, but feel free to adapt these materials and/or use your own materials as you see fit.

# A paradox
- Consider the following sentence:
  -I ain't got no time.
- We all understand this sentence, and we may even say sentences like this sometimes.
  - That means it must be part of our mental grammar.
- But we often hear that sentences like this are "bad English" or "don't have grammar".
  - This sentence in particular uses a double negative and the word ain't, which some people look down on.
- So how can the sentence both be part of our grammar and "not have grammar" at the same time?
  - To understand this, we need to understand the difference between Prescriptivism and Descriptivism.

# Prescriptivism
- **Prescriptivism** is an approach to language that asserts that there is only one "correct" way to talk, and that tries to tell people what they **should** and **shouldn't** do (it prescribes language).
- We often hear **prescriptive** rules in language classes, writing manuals, style guides, online grammar correction sites. These are rules like:
  - Don't use double negatives.
  - Don't split your infinitives.
  - Ain't ain't a word.
  - Don't end sentences with a preposition.
- But English speakers break these rules all the time, and it sounds completely **natural** to native speakers.

I can’t get no satisfaction.

To boldly go where no one has gone before.

If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.

What is she up to?

# Descriptivism
<br>
- An alternative approach is **descriptivism**: an approach to language that seeks to **describe** how people really talk in their daily lives without judgment.
- Linguists take a **descriptive** approach and in this class we'll also take a descriptive approach.
- This is important for several reasons:
  - Linguistics is a science and descriptivism helps maintain a **neutral**, **scientific** point of view.
  - If our goal is to understand people's mental grammars, we won't get very far by focusing on prescriptive rules.
  - It **respects** the language patterns of every individual and community as completely **legitimate** and **valid** ways to talk.
